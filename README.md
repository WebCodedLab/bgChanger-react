React Beginner Project

The background color changes when pressing the button.

Used: Props and useState hook
Styling: Tailwind CSS

First, I created a state for the background color and a function that sets the background color based on the input from the buttons. The buttons are created as a separate component. The Button component takes the color from its props and updates the background color accordingly.
